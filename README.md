## About Us

A Sri Lankan indie studio built on passion, precision, and pixel art.

We are Team Kairo, an indie game studio founded by five passionate students with a shared vision for immersive interactive experiences.

Our mission is to create atmospheric pixel art games that transport players to dreamlike worlds. We believe in the power of storytelling through interactive mediums, blending nostalgia with modern mechanics.

It all started with our participation in EXE 2025, where we developed our first finished title, Floatlands.
